# OMTheme for Ubuntu

This is Yaru theme with some customizations. I also used a mix between Yaru Icons and Breeze Icons to match the colors. Keep in mind that this is my personal theme, I'm not focusing on any other system other than Ubuntu 20.04.

But feel free to make changes as you wish.

To install it, follow the steps bellow:

**Install git**

```
sudo apt install git
```

**Clone this repo**

```
git clone https://github.com/luizomf/yaru-theme-personalized-as-om-theme.git
```

**Install**

```
cd yaru-theme-personalized-as-om-theme/
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

Now just answer some questions and you're good to go.
