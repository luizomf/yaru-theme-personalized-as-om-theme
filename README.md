# OMTheme for Ubuntu

This is Yaru theme with some customizations. I also used a mix between Yaru Icons, Breeze Icons and Dracula Icons to match the colors. Keep in mind that this is my personal theme, I'm not focusing on any other system other than Ubuntu 20.04. Just uploading to be easier for me to reinstall when needed.

But feel free to make changes as you wish and share with the community.

I didn't do much here (just changed some colors and merged some icons), so all the credit goes to the talented people who made all this perfect work.

- The base theme - Yaru Blue - From [Yaru Colors](https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1299514/) (which comes from [Yaru](https://github.com/ubuntu/yaru))
- The [Breeze Icons](https://github.com/KDE/breeze-icons) - From [KDE Plasma](https://github.com/KDE)
- The [Dracula Icons](https://draculatheme.com/gtk) (some of the icons are from Dracula GTK Theme)

# Installation
